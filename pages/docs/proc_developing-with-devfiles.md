# Developing with devfiles


Use the devfile specification to develop a Node.js “Hello World” application. Developing this application introduces you to how a devfile automates and simplifies your development process.

## Prerequisites

To make developing with the devfile specification easier, consider doing the following:

- Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to create a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
- Download [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/) to access your namespace.
- Enable [ingress on minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/) to access your devfile project.
- Install the [odo command line interface (CLI) tool](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/cli_tools/developer-cli-odo#installing-odo) to execute the devfile specification.


## Procedure

1. View the available devfiles:

    ```
    $ odo catalog list components
    ```

1. Run `odo create nodejs _<name of your project>_ --starter` to create a devfile project.
    - Add the `--starter` parameter to include the starter project currently inside the Node.js devfile specification, which makes it easier for you to develop an application.

1. Run `minikube IP` to find your cluster IP address.

1. Run `odo url create _<name you give the url>_ --ingress --host _<IP address>_.nip.io`. Doing so creates an ingress inside your cluster that you can use to access your application using the cluster IP address.
    - Example: `odo url create myfirstproject --ingress --host 192.168.64.2.nip.io`.
    
1. Run `odo push` to build the URL.

## Verification

- To verify that you built your Node.js "Hello World" application successfully, view the application in a web browser by copying and pasting the URL that was produced by running the `odo push` command. Go to the URL and view your "Hello World" application.
